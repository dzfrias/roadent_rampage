## The Making Of

![Our logo](./Extras/logo.webp)

Our team of seven created Roadent Rampage for an annual state-wide competition.
Out of 50 teams, our game won the award for the best game made by a team who
has never competed before!

The game took us about half of a year to make, complete with original models,
code, and music!

### Gameplay

Since the theme of the competition was "breaking conventions", we decided to
not only break conventions in our story, but also in our gameplay.

In our game, one player controls the steering of the car, and the other
manipulates the acceleration. Additionally, the acceleration player aims the gun
on the car, while the steering one shoots it.

The game is a blast to play, and we're truly proud of what we made.
